# Medical Diagnosis and ICD-10 Prediction System

## Overview

This is a comprehensive medical diagnosis and ICD-10 prediction system built with Streamlit. The application combines multiple AI/ML approaches to analyze patient symptoms and provide accurate ICD-10 diagnostic codes. It uses an ensemble methodology that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs), LSTM neural networks, traditional machine learning, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to provide robust diagnostic predictions.

The system now supports both single patient analysis and batch processing of multiple patients via CSV upload, making it suitable for both individual consultations and research/evaluation scenarios.
